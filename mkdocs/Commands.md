Purpur adds a few new commands to the game.

* `/purpur`
    - This command allows reloading the purpur.yml config and viewing the purpur version.

    - **examples**:
        - `/purpur reload` reloads purpur.yml without a restart
        - `/purpur version` shows the current version (same as `/version`)

    - **permission**:
        - `bukkit.command.purpur`

* `/ping`
    - This command allows viewing the ping of players. If you do not specify a player name or player entity selector (`@a`, `@r`, etc) it will show you your own ping.

        - `/ping` shows you your own ping
        - `/ping BillyGalbreath` shows you the ping of BillyGalbreath
        - `/ping @a` shows you the ping of all players
        - `/ping @r` shows you the ping of a random player

    - **permission**:
