Purpur adds a few new permission nodes for some of itâ€™s added features.

By default **all** of these permissions are for OP users only. Any other users will need to be granted the permissions using a permissions plugin.

* **allow.ride.<mob_id&gt;**
    - This permission gives the ability to ride a certain mob by shift
    right clicking it. Once mounted you can use WASD to move around, and spacebar to jump or fly. Just replace "<mob_id&gt;" with the mob's Entity ID.

    - **examples**:
        - `allow.ride.cow`
        - `allow.ride.zombie_pigman`
        - `allow.ride.snow_golem`

* **allow.special.<mob_id&gt;**
    - This permission gives the ability to activate a ridable mob's
    special ability. Not all mobs have a special ability. Just replace "<mob_id&gt;" with
    the mob's Entity ID.

    - **Currently Available Specials**
        - `allow.special.creeper`
            - Ignites when spacebar is pressed
        - `allow.special.dolphin`
            - Spits when spacebar is pressed
        - `allow.special.phantom`
            - Shoots flames when spacebar is pressed
        - `allow.special.wither`
            - Shoots a wither head on mouse click

* **allow.powered.creeper**
    - This permission gives the ability to toggle a creeper's powered state.
    Hold spacebar while not moving to charge the toggle. Instead of blowing up the powered
    state will toggle on or off.
