Welcome to the official documentation source for the [Purpur](../) project.

Purpur is a fork of Paper used by the Pl3xCraft server. It contains many gameplay changes to suit our server that are deemed too wild to be included directly upstream into Paper.

This wiki was last updated to Build [#936](https://ci.pl3x.net/job/Purpur/840/) ([`c7b279`](../commit/c7b279fe1bc55120c2902609d124f2940f74b231))
