### spawn-data
Spawn data is a map of key->value pairs for each entity and it‚Äôs natural spawn settings per biome. The value consists of 3 integers representing the weight, minimum group, and maximum group.

Weight represents the chance the entity has to spawn. It‚Äôs not really a percent chance, it‚Äôs the number of chances this entity gets in the rng roll. Take the ocean biome, for example. If you add up all the weights for all the entities you get a total of 540. Enderman has a weight of 10 here, so it gets 10/540 chance of winning the rng roll.

There are still other rules to be met before a mob is spawned. Each entity has their own set of rules, which can be learned by researching the official minecraft wiki or google. But, for example, lets say a water location was chosen to spawn a mob at random and enderman won the rng roll. The enderman will _not_ spawn because it‚Äôs in water. This tick the spawn chance gets skipped and nothing spawns. The rng roll happens every tick until the mob cap has been reached, so keep all this in mind when creating your weights.

The minimum and maximum group values are exactly as they sound. It is the number of mobs of this type that will spawn from this attempt.
